Questions for Kayvan:
What about multi- and self-edges?
What kinds of failure would be interesting?
What about the large k-cores?

Things to share with Kayvan:
Visualizations
Size of connected components
Tension between smaller supply chain base for each firm (local security) and global instability arising from sparseness
Should we use the directionality to investigate cascading failure models?

Things I want to figure out before meeting Kayvan:
What is the exponent of the degree distribution? Should I expect quick failure?
Different failure modes that are studied
Has the robustness of supply chain networks been specifically studied?
