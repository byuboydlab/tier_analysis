Hi Kayvan,

Some initial questions we could think about asking the data:

1) How many connected components are there under certain types of deletion?
2) How many Tier one nodes have at least one path back to Tier 4/5 under certain types of deletion?

Types of deletion to consider:
1) Delete China, Italy, and possibly other impacted countries.
2) Delete all links between China and the US, China and Canada, and other country pairs that have had disagreements over the virus handling
3) Delete random edges with a certain probability

Types of tier 1 nodes to specialize to in question 2:
1) All firms
2) US firms
3) Chinese firms
4) Canadian firms

Later on, we could figure out equilibration speeds and how they are affected by the deletion of China, etc., but these simplest things would be good to get to first.

If we get the chance to share the data, I will see if I get a chance to look at it. I will also happily read grant calls you know about and see what we might apply for.

Best,

Zach
