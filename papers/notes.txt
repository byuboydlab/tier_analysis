Fig. A1 -- How many singleton clusters? More to the point, what is the distribution of cluster sizes? Is there a giant component?
Fig. B2 -- What does this look like when we use log eigenvector centrality? This is sometimes more informative visually

3 -- What eigenvector is this? Do we account for the directed structure somehow?
  -- Consider upgrading Louvain to Leiden
6 -- at the firm level, isn't there much more fragmentation without China?
  -- "simulations" is not the right word probably. Try "computations".
  -- Why car manufacturers?
7 -- Are all these clustering results robust to random seeds in the Louvain algorithm? We should assess significance if possible.
  -- Is there real clustering structure? Use a permutation test.
8 -- Last claim in section 4 is strong

Which types of supply/value chain relationships are included?

I should go through and make sure that the claims/interpretations of the clustering/centrality results are reasonable.

TODO: Show one of these figures to the group for group meeting today

pdf paper
TODO -- make sure we are using multiple comparisons correction in all claims of significance
TODO -- look carefully at how good our sampling procedure is
TODO -- What is really the right centrality score?
TODO -- Maybe we should look at variance of centrallity under random firm deletion, random country deletion, or random international trade disruption

Trophic network centrality
Participation coefficient, hub scores (betweenness centrality)

Are there any hyper-edges here?
Can we get dynamic data?
